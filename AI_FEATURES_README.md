# AI Features Scaffolding

This directory contains the scaffolding for AI-powered album analysis features. All components are currently commented out and ready for future implementation.

## Files Created

### Core AI Components
- `js/ai/album-analyzer.js` - OpenAI integration for album analysis
- `js/ui/album-input.js` - UI component for album input and preview
- `css/ai-components.css` - Styles for AI components

### Integration Points
- `index.html` - Added commented-out HTML for AI controls and panels
- `script.js` - Added commented-out integration code

## Features Ready to Implement

### Album Analyzer (`AlbumAnalyzer`)
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for album analysis
- Automatic generation of album metadata including:
  - Core drive and structural tension
  - Emotional output and environmental context
  - Subsystem role and metadata tags
  - Year estimation and genre classification
- API key validation and error handling

### Album Input UI (`AlbumInput`)
- Clean input form for album title and artist
- Real-time AI analysis with loading states
- Preview of analysis results before adding to graph
- Edit functionality for analysis results
- Integration with existing graph system

### Styling
- Modern, responsive design
- Status messages and loading states
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Wing-based color coding
- Consistent with existing UI theme

## How to Activate

When ready to implement AI features:

1. **Uncomment HTML sections** in `index.html`:
   - AI controls in header
   - AI input panel container
   - Script and CSS includes

2. **Uncomment JavaScript code** in `script.js`:
   - AI initialization functions
   - Event listeners for controls
   - DOM ready integration

3. **Uncomment component files**:
   - `js/ai/album-analyzer.js`
   - `js/ui/album-input.js`
   - `css/ai-components.css`

4. **Set up API key**:
   - Get OpenAI API key
   - Use "Set API Key" button to store securely
   - Features will automatically activate

## Usage Flow

1. User clicks "Add Album with AI" button
2. Panel opens with input fields
3. User enters album title and artist name
4. AI analyzes album and generates metadata
5. User reviews analysis in preview panel
6. User can edit or confirm analysis
7. Album is added to graph with generated data
8. Network view updates with new album

## Technical Integration

- Seamlessly integrates with existing graph system
- Uses same album data structure as manual entries
- Automatically triggers graph regeneration
- Maintains existing filtering and visualization features
- Adds `ai_generated` flag for tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Batch album analysis
- Custom prompts for different analysis types
- Analysis history and caching
- Export/import of AI-generated albums
- Integration with music APIs for additional data
